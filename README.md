# chatgpt-git-commit

Let ChatGPT generate a git commit message based on your git diff.

### WARNING NOTE:

- You will need your own OPENAPI API KEY
- You will be billed for each use. Visit [OPENAI Pricing Page](https://openai.com/pricing)
- This functionality isn't deterministic
   [The generated git commit message will differ on each attempt even if the input is the same.]
- It's cool but it isn't the right way of doing git commits
    [This was a side project to understand what aspects of brain-draining stuff can be automated, and this is definitely not meant for production use for large systems.]


  You are free to fork, modify, and make it more reliable for others on the internet.
